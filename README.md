My name is kothapalli Jayanth


I am a  Data Science enthusiast with skills in Machine learning(time being). I have worked frameworks such as Scikit-learn and Flask.I have experience in using statistical analysis and machine learning to extract insights from data and build predictive models. I have built several End to End projects with machine learning(time being) and also having good programming skills in python.

In this github, you will find a collection of my data science projects. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, data visualization and  machine learning. I have also included a brief summary of each project and the tools and techniques used to build them.
 
 
PROJECTS:

Project 1: Predicting Car price.
In this project, I analyzed  dataset with the given attributies  to predict car price . I used  RandomForestRegressor to build predictive models and achieved an accuracy of 85%. I also created a dashboard to visualize the results and help the company understand the factors that influence car-price.

Tools and techniques used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash.

Project 2: Heart-disease Classifiction.
In this project, I used different types of classification algorithms like KNN,LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND RANDOMFORESTCALSSIFIER. I also used SEABORN to visualize the correlation matrix . Among them Logistic regression give maximum accuracy :88%.

Tools and techniques used: Python, sklearn,seaborn, NumPy, matplotlib.
